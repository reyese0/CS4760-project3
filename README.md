<br>Prompts:
<br>Write a program in c (worker.c file). Use the following pseudocode to implement the worker.c using message queues. It should wait for a message from oss, check the clock, and then send a message back. The worker should do some periodic output that says how may messages it received from oss.
<br>Summary: The inital generated code seemed to work well. I updated the output messages to follow the format in the requirements.
